# Eink Alarm Clock

This is just a small side project to make an alarm clock that wont keep me up at night (Waveshare 800Ã—480, 7.5inch E-Ink raw display), and allows for setting your alarms through a calendar dav provider. The audio is also stream based using vlc in the background, I figured JPop would get me out of bed so I use http://listen.moe/stream (which is also why a japanese supporting font is included.)

This currently runs on ubuntu server on a raspberry pi 3b, the code is shit, but functional enough to be used. I plan to do a rewrite and redesign using a microcontroller and C.

I can't advise using this at all.
